# Math Score Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict math scores based on various factors including Gender, Ethnicity, Parent’s Background, Lunch, and Test Preparation Course. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we seek to create a predictive model that offers valuable insights into academic performance.

## Features
- Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.
- Factors in key variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parent’s Background, Lunch, and Test Preparation Course.
- Offers accurate predictions for math scores.
- Aims to revolutionize academic insights and student support systems.
